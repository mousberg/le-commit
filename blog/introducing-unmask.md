# Introducing Unmask: AI-Powered Hiring Verification

In today's competitive job market, hiring managers face an unprecedented challenge: how to verify the authenticity of candidates when resumes can be easily fabricated, LinkedIn profiles can be misleading, and traditional reference checks are time-consuming and often unreliable.

## The Problem We're Solving

**Resume Fraud is on the Rise**: Studies show that up to 85% of job applications contain some form of misrepresentation. From inflated job titles to fabricated work experience, candidates are increasingly willing to bend the truth to land their dream job.

**LinkedIn Profiles Can Be Misleading**: While LinkedIn provides a professional facade, it's easy to create impressive-looking profiles that don't reflect reality. Fake endorsements, exaggerated roles, and non-existent companies are more common than you might think.

**GitHub Activity Doesn't Tell the Whole Story**: A candidate's GitHub profile might show impressive commit activity, but are those contributions meaningful? Are they actually the author of the code they claim to have written?

**Reference Checks are Broken**: Traditional reference checks are time-consuming, often biased, and surprisingly easy to game. Many candidates provide friends or colleagues who will give glowing reviews regardless of actual performance.
