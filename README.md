# The project🕵️‍♂️ GhostBuster

**GhostBuster** is a lightweight AI agent that helps hiring managers detect potentially fraudulent engineering candidates — before the interview even happens.

Built in 48 hours at [Hackathon Name], it uses LLMs, public profile data, and timeline analysis to flag suspicious candidates and generate smart follow-ups.

[![Uses LLaMA 3](https://img.shields.io/badge/Model-LLaMA%203-green)]()

## ⚡ What It Does

> Stop ghost applicants. Flag fake resumes. Build trust early in hiring.

ShadowCheck acts as a credibility filter during candidate screening. Just drop in a CV and public profile links (LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.), and the agent:

- ✅ Parses and analyzes candidate timelines
- 🔍 Flags red flags (e.g. overlapping jobs, no GitHub activity, cloned identities)
- 📊 Computes a **credibility score** with explainable logic
- 💬 Suggests next steps (follow-up questions, async reference checks)
- 🔁 (Bonus) Detects ghost candidate patterns over time
