description: **Frontend ID Strategy**: All frontend components use `applicant_id` as the primary identifier for consistency. **Backend ID Mapping**: APIs accept `applicant_id` and internally join to `ashby_candidates` table to get `ashby_id` when needed for external API calls. **Separation of Concerns**: Frontend handles business logic with applicant entities, backend handles integration-specific identifiers. **Reusable Utility**: Use `getAshbyIdFromApplicantId()` from `@/lib/ashby/utils` for consistent ashby_id lookups in APIs.
