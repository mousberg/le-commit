# The Future of Remote Hiring: AI-Driven Interview Integrity

The landscape of hiring has fundamentally changed. Remote work has become the norm, and with it, the need for sophisticated tools to ensure interview integrity has never been greater.

## The Evolution of Remote Interviews

Remote interviews have evolved from a convenience to a necessity. However, this shift has brought new challenges:

- **Trust Issues**: How can we ensure candidates aren't receiving unauthorized help?
- **Technology Gaps**: Different platforms and tools create inconsistent experiences
- **Scalability**: Manual monitoring doesn't scale with growing organizations

## AI as the Solution

Artificial intelligence offers a comprehensive solution to these challenges:

### Advanced Pattern Recognition
AI systems can detect subtle patterns that human observers might miss:
- Unusual eye movements or gaze patterns
