# Getting Started with AI-Powered Interview Anti-Cheating

In today's remote work environment, ensuring interview integrity has become more challenging than ever. Traditional methods of monitoring candidates during interviews are often insufficient and can create an uncomfortable experience for both interviewers and candidates.

## The Challenge of Remote Interview Integrity

Remote interviews present unique challenges:
